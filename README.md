This chapter I thought was kind of challenging to me, I think the hardest part for me is
remembering all the syntax for everything. I understand the MVC and model and what goes where
and have a good understanding of what everything does, but just remembering the syntax is challenging
for me.
The hardest thing for me, is just keeping track of everything and how they all link up.

Chapter 9
I understand what the author is doing in the Startup.cs file when we change the routes. I just don't understand how he's doing or how
we are supposed to know that this is the syntax to use.
I really like the View Component that the author used, it was very useful and easy to understand, they are a lot like the 
parial views we are using in our Spicy Thai project.
Lastly the thing I struggled with the most was the shopping cart part. Just how everything communicated with each other
and having to make the extension methods and then just all the different syntax that was needed to get it to work smoothly.
It's really cool to see how it all works though.

Chapter 10
This chapter was the easiest to me so far. I'm starting to understand what everything is doing and
how it is all working together. And binding data to the certain views is starting to make sense as well.
I always have to read the parts where the author is using LINQ a couple different times, to get it to really 
sink in. But after 2-3 times it starts to make sense.

Chapter 11
It was interesting to see how using the IProductRespository as an interface for the EFProductRepository makes things work.
It was also interesting how the author did the Create and Delete functions in the controller differently than we did in SpicyThai.

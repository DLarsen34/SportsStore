# SportsStore
This chapter I thought was kind of challenging to me, I think the hardest part for me is
remembering all the syntax for everything. I understand the MVC and model and what goes where
and have a good understanding of what everything does, but just remembering the syntax is challenging
for me.
The hardest thing for me, is just keeping track of everything and how they all link up.

Chapter 9
I understand what the author is doing in the Startup.cs file when we change the routes. I just don't understand how he's doing or how
we are supposed to know that this is the syntax to use.
I really like the View Component that the author used, it was very useful and easy to understand, they are a lot like the 
parial views we are using in our Spicy Thai project.

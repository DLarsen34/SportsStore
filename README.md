# SportsStore
This chapter I thought was kind of challenging to me, I think the hardest part for me is
remembering all the syntax for everything. I understand the MVC and model and what goes where
and have a good understanding of what everything does, but just remembering the syntax is challenging
for me.
The hardest thing for me, is just keeping track of everything and how they all link up.
